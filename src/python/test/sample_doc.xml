Russian Tech and Cyber Highlights is a compendium of stories in the Russian media on technology and cyber issues. This issue covers 6 - 27 February 2019.

Ex-FSB Official, Ex-Kaspersky Lab Employee Sentenced for Treason. The Moscow District Military Court sentenced one of the former heads of the Federal Security Service's (FSB) Information Security Center, Sergey Mikhaylov, and former head of the cyber incident investigation department at Kaspersky Lab, Ruslan Stoyanov, to 22 and 14 years, respectively, to a high-security penal colony for treason, an Interfax correspondent reported on 26 February from the courtroom. Kremlin chief spokesman Dmitriy Peskov told reporters on 27 January that "It is not the Kremlin's area to comment on such cases and court rulings" (Interfax).

Russia To Establish Internet Monitoring Center. Premier Dmitriy Medvedev has ordered the creation of an Internet monitoring center in Russia, the nonstate Interfax news agency reported on 22 February.The center should be set up by 1 July 2019 to "provide integrity, the stability of functioning and security of the public communication network amid potential cyber security threats, which can affect the operation of telecom providers, the networks themselves, as well as the Russian segment of the Internet." "The monitoring center will aggregate and process information on the work of telecom operators, as well as any emergency situations in the communication networks. The aggregation of this information will allow forecasting possible risks for the stable functioning of the communication network through analysing system failures in its work." The monitoring system should be fully implemented by 1 January 2020 under Russain Government media and communications watchdog Roskomnadzor. The FSB and the Communications Ministry will jointly work out cooperation between the monitoring system and state information systems.

Sberbank Executive Calls For Changes To Reduce Losses From Cyber Attacks. Stanislav Kuznetsov, deputy chairman of the Executive Board of Sberbank, told journalists on the sidelines of the Russian Investment Forum in Sochi that damages from cyber attacks may continue to grow 50-80 percent a year and called for "fundamental measures implying rapid changes with respect to ending this trend" (Interfax, 22 February). Sberbank is Russia's largest and oldest bank and, as most large banks, state-owned.

More than 600 organizations are exchanging information on cyber security through the Central Bank's FinCERT (The Financial Sector Computer Emergency Response Team) system, the deputy governor of the bank, Dmitriy Skobelkin, said at the Ural Forum on the Security of Information in the Financial Sphere. Skobelkin said: "Today more than 600 organizations, including 437 banks, 39 non-bank credit organizations, 77 insurance organizations, and 63 other organizations are exchanging information through FinCERT" (Interfax, 19 February).

Ukrainian President Claims Russia Launched Cyber Attacks on Ukraine. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on 26 February told IT industry leaders in Kyiv that on 24-25 February "there were cyber attacks from the Russian Federation."

Ukraine's Central Election Commission (CEC) head Tatyana Slipachuk said CEC "is taking a number of measures to ensure cyber security during the upcoming presidential election amid the aggression on the part of the Russian Federation" (Interfax, 8 February).
